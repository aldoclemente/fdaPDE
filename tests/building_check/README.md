# Building checks on non-standard configurations


### Install docker 
Docker is needed to run the building checks on non-standard configurations.
To install docker, run from terminal:
```
  sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Finally, reboot your PC or run from terminal:
```
  sudo reboot
```

### Running building checks
Different shell scripts are available to check the development version of `fdaPDE` package on non-standard configurations. Assuming your working directory is `fdaPDE/tests/building_checks/`, run, from terminal, one of the following commands.

  - Building check on Fedora using R (unstable) and gcc as compiler, run from terminal:
  ```
    ./fedora_gcc_devel.sh
  ```
  
  - Building check on Fedora using R (unstable) and clang as compiler, run from terminal:
  ```
    ./fedora_clang_devel.sh
  ```
  
  - Building check on Debian using R (patched) and gcc as compiler, run from terminal:
  ```
    ./debian_gcc_patched.sh
  ```

Finally, check the newly created directory `<distro>_<compiler>_<R_status>`.
